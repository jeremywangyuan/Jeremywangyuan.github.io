# 勵志佳句

>Martha Graham : What people in the world think of you is really none of your business.

- Some men have thousands of reasons why they cannot do what they want to, when all they need is one reason why they can.
- No artist is ahead of his time. He/She is the time; it is just that others are behind the times.
- Great dancers are not great because of their technique, they are great because of their passion.
